# Sync-AD2Teams

This project has mostly been copied and modified from Dan Stevenson At Microsoft

https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Teams-Blog/Syncing-Security-Groups-with-team-membership/ba-p/241959.

This can be used as an alternative to Azure Dynamic Membership to sync AD groups to Teams groups.
